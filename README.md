# Study3_experiment_programe

This repo contains all the source code of study 3_3. There are two folders.
The folder 'software' contains the experimental programme run on screen-based devices (PC, laptop, Raspberry Pi etc.). The folder 'hardware' contains the code that need to be uploaded onto a hand-held device or a desk-sit control box.
